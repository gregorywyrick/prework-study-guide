          <li>Although we assign a variable in the same way when using an array, the values are surrounded by brackets with each string inside of qutiation marks</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a signle code block to be executed over and over</li>
